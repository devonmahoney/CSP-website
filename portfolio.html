	<p1> I did my project with my partner, Mikayla. We made a stereo simulation that first draws a stereo, and then asks the user if they want to play music. If the user says yes, then music notes will appear and go around the stereo to simulate music playing. Then, it will ask if they want to play another song, and it will do the same thing again. <p1>
